<h1>Halal Burgers on H Street NE That Hit Different</h1>

Whether you're coming from Union Station, walking over from Atlas District, or grabbing a bite before hitting the H Street bars, we've got the halal burgers DC has been waiting for.</p>

<h2>Why Our Halal Burgers Are the Real Deal</h2>

<p>At Nash & Smashed, halal isn't an afterthought—it's how we do things. Every burger patty is made with premium halal-certified beef, hand-smashed on our flat-top grill to get those signature crispy edges while staying juicy inside. We use fresh-baked buns, real cheese, and toppings that actually taste like something.</p>

<p>Our menu goes beyond basic. Stack it with bacon (halal turkey bacon, of course), load it with jalapeños, or go all-in with our Double Stack Smash.

Every bite is bold, every ingredient is certified, and every meal is served with that Nash & Smashed attitude.</p>
